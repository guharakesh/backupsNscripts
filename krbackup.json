Nice. We've put together a little post to introduce you to the Ghost editor and get you started. You can manage your content by signing in to the admin area at `<your blog URL>/ghost/`. When you arrive, you can select this post from a list on the left and see a preview of it on the right. Click the little pencil icon at the top of the preview to edit this post and read the next section!\n\n## Getting Started\n\nGhost uses something called Markdown for writing. Essentially, it's a shorthand way to manage your post formatting as you write!\n\nWriting in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use *shortcuts* to **style** your content. For example, a list:\n\n* Item number one\n* Item number two\n    * A nested item\n* A final item\n\nor with numbers!\n\n1. Remember to buy some milk\n2. Drink the milk\n3. Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it\n\n### Links\n\nWant to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in url, like http://ghost.org - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to [the Ghost website](http://ghost.org). Neat.\n\n### What about Images?\n\nImages work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:\n\n![The Ghost Logo](https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png)\n\nNot sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:\n\n![A bowl of bananas]\n\n\n### Quoting\n\nSometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. It was probably very wisdomous. Is wisdomous a word? Find out in a future release when we introduce spellcheck! For now - it's definitely a word.\n\n> Wisdomous - it's definitely a word.\n\n### Working with Code\n\nGot a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline `<code>` blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.\n\n    .awesome-thing {\n        display: block;\n        width: 100%;\n    }\n\n### Ready for a Break? \n\nThrow 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.\n\n---\n\n### Advanced Usage\n\nThere's one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can  write plain old HTML and it'll still work! Very flexible.\n\n<input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"I'm an input field!\" />\n\nThat should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you think :)","html":"<p>You're live! Nice.

I was active, sure, but for me that meant I spent a lot of time frolicking my parents' big yard, swimming, and riding my bike all over the rural area we lived in. Otherwise, I was mostly what I would call a loner, reading books and writing, spending time outside, and being an eccentric kid (e.g. lists of all of my stuffed animals and their names, bookmark and pencil collections). I was also pretty shy and nervous when it came to groups of people, and that only highlighted my natural clumsiness. \n\nThis all culminated into a hatred of gym class, which, who doesn't go through at some point? I remember completely dreading gym class and the two things that stuck with me were:\n\n1. My gym teacher always told me to put \"more butt into it\" when I couldn't serve a volleyball over the net, resulting in everyone laughing and looking at my butt. I still don't think I could serve a volleyball.\n2. Once, when playing kickball, I actually kicked the ball with fury *insert proud smile* and the \"pitcher\" quickly grabbed it and threw it at me with *more* fury. He hit the side of my knee and I went down, left with the very physical memory of that embarassment the rest of the school day (and apparently my life). \n\nSo, really, gym and teamwork didn't really come together for me at all. I felt like if I were to do something physically active, I'd be better off on my own. \n\n####Exercise by choice\nIn high school, I started running a little with my sister, but that kind of fizzled when I went to college and relied on a cardio class to get my healthy amount of exercise into my schedule. That summer after freshman year, I started running a mile or so a day, but I never really went further than that. \n\nMy freshman roommate, Kelsey, and I began running together and our endurance was similar, we really enjoyed spending the time together, and we kept each other going. I wanted to stay fit and spend time with my friend and that's exactly what happened. \n\nBy the end of senior year, we were hooked.\n\n####Competition\nI forgot to mention that I'm competetive by nature. The signs were all there, but I didn't really embrace this as part of my chracter until I was about 21 and ran my first 5K. My dad had suggested I run it with him and some friends, so I accepted the challenge, terrified. The race was at a local high school in March. The weather was March in Ohio. It was freezing and I remember wondering why this gymnasium full of people actually *wanted* to do this. I finished and felt absolutely awesome. Everyone was cheering the finishers on and the runners were gathering inside to commiserate and eat some fruit. My dad and his friends joined me and we sat down to chat until awards were announced. This was a whole new world to me!\n\nPlacing in a sporting event was something that had never even crossed my mind. I remember a rush of excitement as I realized I could do this and I was in love with this...sport (could I even call it a sport if I was participating in it?!).  \n\n####Running and racing now\nAnd here I am now, running a 5K a month, running the occasional 10K, participating in the Cleveland 10 miler every year, and now I'm training for my 6th half marathon. The days of scoffing at \"crazy runners\" are over and I'm completely immersed in the way this activity makes me feel. I get mental and physical rewards from it daily, stretching from the actual \"runner's high\" (that's a whole other post) to the way writing about my surprising passion is making me feel right now. When I say \"I'm a runner,\" I still get a weird feeling like I shouldn't be in this category of people, labeled an athlete, but I also get a rush of pride. I'm proud of what I've done in the past 4 years or so, and I feel like there's something to be said for people like me. You can be athletic, healthy, and accomplished without being the kid that pitched the ball too hard in kickball and scarred a clumsy pre-teen for life. \n\n-K","html":"<p>I haven't always been as active as I am today...</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"clumsy\">Clumsy</h4>\n\n<p>When I was young, sports were the last thing I wanted to do.

I think every now and then I'd trudge along behind my far more athletic friends in high school. The first couple years of college, I tried Couch-to-5K, with little success. The first time I really remember enjoying it was the summer after my sophomore year of college. I was working during the day and studying for the MCAT at night. It was a busy, but fun, summer. And after a long day, nothing felt better than going for an evening run around University Circle. I'm still not sure what sparked my interest, but I do know when I became a \"runner\".\n\n### On setting goals:\n\nAt the end of 2013, as everyone was setting resolutions, I was thinking about what my own would be. It happened to be an episode of Modern Family that inspired me. In this episode, Phil Dunphy was powering through the miles on an elliptical. He had set a goal to travel (symbolically) from his home in LA to Canada, via elliptical. Even though his efforts were subject to ridicule in the show, I thought this was a fantastic goal. So keeping in the spirit, I resolved that in 2014, I would run 300 miles: the distance between Cleveland and Toronto. At the time I wouldn't have dared calling myself as such, but that was when I became a runner.\n\n![My hero!](/content/images/2015/Mar/1200-2x1.jpg)\n\n\n### On failing:\n\nMy first road race was hard. I had only been on a treadmill up till then, and once I got outside, I realized I was using completely different muscles. At mile two, I slowed to a walk. That is, until an older woman passed by me and shouted, \"You're almost done, don't stop now!\" Thank you for the encouragement, complete stranger. I won't let you down. I picked it back up and finished the race at a run.\n\nFrom then on, progress was good. I bought winter running clothes! I actually wore them! I got up early most mornings, and ran through the wind and the ice.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, my pace was encouraging. According to [my RunKeeper](http://runkeeper.com/user/rakeshguha/profile) stats, if I kept it up, I would finish by September. I thought that maybe I'd picked too easy of a goal! Luckily, Kaitlin and I had set another - to run one race per month, the entire year. \n\nAnd while we kept up that goal, I let my other one slide. I slowed down in the summer. Maybe the comfortable weather made me lazy. But for one reason or another, I got off track. And by the end of the year, I was immensely off course.\n\nAround November, I knew I wasn't going to be able to pull it off. It was kind of a load off my shoulders, thinking I could take it easy for the rest of the year.\n\nUnfortunately, my stupid running partner had to go and ask me how much more I had left. How many more miles per week would I have to put in to finish?\n\nAt that point, it was eight. Then ten. Then twelve?\n\nUp until the end, no matter how big that number got, no matter how much I wanted to say \"it's hopeless, I quit\", Kaitlin would tell me no. \"That's hard, but it's still doable. Do it.\" Fine, stupid running partner. I won't let you down.\n\nI ran an amazing amount (for me) those last few weeks. Nearly 50 miles in the first two weeks of December! But then the next two weeks, almost nothing. For various...reasons? Excuses? I couldn't keep up the pace.\n\nBy New Year's Eve, I had run 285 miles. I didn't make it.\n\n### On succeeding:\n\nIt took me until three weeks into 2015 to finish those last 15 miles. The last mile was a little bittersweet; it felt great to hit 300, but it was a bummer that I couldn't do it in a year. It felt like failing.\n\nAnd it felt like that until a couple hours later, when I decided that by the end of 2015, I will run 350 miles. Maybe I fell short last year, but I can sure as hell do it this year, and with the stakes raised.\n\nOn paper, my goal was 300 miles. But what was I actually trying to achieve? \n\nI was trying to be healthier and more active.\nI had succeeded.\n\nI was trying to spend more time with my friends.\nI had succeeded.\n\nI was trying to get to know my city, its streets, and the people in it.\nI had succeeded. In 2014, I ran 10 5K's and two 10K's, in neighborhoods all over Cleveland.\n\nI became a runner when I set my goals. When I followed through. When I fell short. When I set more.\n\n--------\n\nAnd as of yesterday, I set another. This May, I'm going to be attempting my first half-marathon. I had intended to do another 10K at the Cleveland Marathon, like last year. But... I did that last year. And I'm not quite at the point to be upping my pace (I'll explain later), so I have to step it up somehow. I mean, what good is a goal if it's going to be easy? My training is starting a little late, but if I stick with the plan, it should be possible. That's what K tells me, anyway, and I guess for now I'll believe her.\n\nWho knows if I'll make it, but I'll still be a \"runner\" just the same.\n\n-R\n","html":"<p>I don't remember how I got interested in running.

When I set more.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>And as of yesterday, I set another. This May, I'm going to be attempting my first half-marathon. I had intended to do another 10K at the Cleveland Marathon, like last year. But... I did that last year. And I'm not quite at the point to be upping my pace (I'll explain later), so I have to step it up somehow. I mean, what good is a goal if it's going to be easy? My training is starting a little late, but if I stick with the plan, it should be possible. That's what K tells me, anyway, and I guess for now I'll believe her.</p>\n\n<p>Who knows if I'll make it, but I'll still be a \"runner\" just the same.</p>\n\n<p>-R</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1426574455073,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1426628281223,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1426574545701,"published_by":1},{"id":7,"uuid":"0aba9493-f4f6-444f-8add-2bdccf6e9689","title":"4th Annual Lakewood Jig and Jog","slug":"4th-annual-lakewood-jig-and-jog","markdown":"####Saturday, March 20, 2015\n####45°F, 9:30am at West Park Station\n![Bloody Mary](/content/images/2015/Mar/cropped-bloody.jpg)\n---\nHi everyone!

I was living in Cleveland and going to school right next door to this landmark for at least 3 years before I did any exploring. I think this was because I was afraid of getting lost among the hills and winding trails, but it also felt sort of...disrespectful. It’s not unknown that I have an appreciation for grim and strange things, but running through a cemetery seemed a bit too much. Once I jogged through those gates, though, everything changed. \n\nI don’t feel unwelcome when it comes to running in the cemetery because I feel like I run differently here. I take my time. **I run in awe.** Manmade construction on runs isn’t always my favorite (I prefer nature’s creations on my runs), but the gravemarkers, mausoleums, and monuments here work with nature in such a beautiful way that I end up breathless (and not because of the run or the massive hills that are wonderful for training). My favorite spot is down by the Lakeview dam. Once you get down there, the whole place opens to a clearing among the trees and landscaping that is absolutely surreal (photos can’t do the feel of the area justice). The peace, the nature, the mausoleums separated from all of the other gravesites–it’s all just perfect. Even during the not-so-green months in Cleveland, the Lakeview Cemetery is a treasure.\n\n-K\n\n![](/content/images/2015/Apr/lv2.png)\n\n\n\n### Downtown\n\n![](/content/images/2015/Apr/11085890_10203796771265689_558827726_o.jpg)\n\nOh, manmade construction isn’t your favorite? That’s okay _IT’S MY FAVORITE_. Seriously, I’ll never say no to nature (we are the Forest City after all), but I get my biggest highs from zigging and zagging between pedestrian traffic on the sidewalks during rush hour. My typical route takes me down past AsiaTown, Tower Press, CSU, and other such Cleveland strongholds, but today I’m going to feature my runs through the heart of downtown.\n\nLiving in Reserve, all I have to do is turn a corner to be in the middle of the hype and excitement of Cleveland’s revival. On one of my recent runs, there was a show getting started at Playhouse just as I was going past on Euclid and 14th. The crowds were filling in, getting in lines, looking into restaurants, taking pictures of the chandelier. It was a reminder that our city, and our downtown, is still something novel, something to be taken in and experienced. And running through the streets, with visitors stepping aside to let me through, makes me feel very much a part of the city and the experience.\n\nThis run ended on St. Clair with a beautiful view of Cleveland’s present and future. On one side, the Fountain of Eternal Life, framed by the silhouettes of Key and Terminal towers. On the other, our new Hilton Hotel being built alongside the Cleveland Convention Center.

We quickly claimed our bibs, pinned them on with some struggle, and soaked up some last minute heat in the car before heading back out to [bathroom, then the starting line](http://www.keeprunningcle.com/munday-runday-mind-games/). The three of us lined up and (respectfully) ogled the dogs for a bit.

The three of us kept pace with each other throughout the entire course, making for an enjoyable race, keeping each other company and making jokes along the way. This was also a great post-Cleveland 10 miler race for K; her legs were in need of a less rigorous course and this flat route was perfect for active recovery! We also found that the crowd was incredibly accommodating. Perhaps this was because everyone knew to be conscious of the dogs on the course, but it was definitely one of the more polite crowds we’ve run with. We really appreciated that whether they were moving for strollers, puppies, or fellow runners, everyone seemed to have manners on the mind. \n\nOverall, this race was a lot smoother than last month’s for a few reasons, the first being that [R preregistered](http://www.keeprunningcle.com/munday-runday-preregistration/)! This wasn’t until past the guaranteed race shirt deadline, but he’s learning! And, in all fairness, K almost missed the cutoff as well. Also, K’s dad drove and parking at the high school was plentiful! This eliminated a lot of the flustered feelings we get before most races. Bonus: K’s dad didn’t step on a nail the night before the race, so that’s certainly a positive as well!\n\nIf you’re not a winter runner, this is a great way to start off race season and get into the groove.
